# 04 - Lesson Four: Redux and Redux-Saga #

## Why Redux ##
There is a big debate that [Redux is dead](https://medium.com/rexlabs/redux-is-dead-long-live-redux-745d0cb26423), and that with the [new hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) and [async rendering](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/03/27/update-on-async-rendering.html), you don't need redux.  
As well there are [other opinions](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2018/03/redux-not-dead-yet/), which says the opposite, that Redux still has values that are not provided by all these new features.  
I am leaning to says that Redux is going to be useful as a `State Management` in a large application.  
For smaller size application, you don't need it.  

## Why Redux-Saga ##

## Setup Redux ##

install redux:

```sh
npm i redux react-redux react-router-redux redux-saga
```
